## 🌟 Our Wow Factor: The Join Community Option
Unlike food delivery apps like Swiggy or Zomato, NourishNet goes beyond just transactions.  
Our **Join Community** feature lets customers in the same office or locality join a shared tiffin group:  

- 👥 Eat together, like a family, not just as individuals  
- 💸 Unlock group discounts for customers  
- 🚴 Consolidated deliveries = reduced costs for vendors and delivery partners  
- ❤️ Turns daily meals into a *social experience*  

This is the core innovation that transforms **meals into communities**.
